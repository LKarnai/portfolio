<h4>Objective:</h4>

To create my Freelance Web Developer and Design Portfolio.

<h4>Motivation:</h4>

The website will showcase my most recent projects and collaborations, that will promote my coding knowledge and design talents. The site will be built in phases to include branding, coding and design abilities, services, blogging, contact information and networking. Documentation will be used to track development, decision-making and analysis, problems and debugging solutions, etc. 

<h4>Code:</h4>

This project will be built using raw code; HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript.

<h4>Design</h4>

Responsive Web Design: 
I will be building the website with the mobile-first concept, starting with a version for the relatively smaller display and adding progressive enhancement to larger screen display sizes; tablet to full screen PC's. UX/UI will focus on lean and neat practical design with strong, prioritized features to capitalize on the explosion of mobile internet use and ISO. 
This one-page informational, static site will include smooth navigable sections, modern design annimations, with a combination of creativity and current bold trends.

<h4>Workflow</h4>

Carefully planned assignments and tasks will be tracked in phases, with outlined project cards, via the GitHub Project section.
